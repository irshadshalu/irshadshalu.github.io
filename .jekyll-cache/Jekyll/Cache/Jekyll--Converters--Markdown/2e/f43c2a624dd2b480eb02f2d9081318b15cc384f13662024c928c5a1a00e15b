I"<p>What better alternative to name your first post ever with â€œHello, World!â€, than anything else?</p>

<p>To be honest, I donâ€™t think the first program Iâ€™ve ever written was Hello World though, I donâ€™t even remember what I wrote, but I do remember getting excited about printing text in different colours in BASIC. Ah, the good old <code class="highlighter-rouge">10 CLS</code> times.</p>
