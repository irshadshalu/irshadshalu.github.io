I"ð<p>Itâ€™s a good bright sunday, I had a nice lunch, took a short nap and now back infront of the laptop - bored and thinking of doing something productive.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s when I remembered <a href="https://svelte.dev/"><strong>Svelte</strong></a>; the super awesome brand new web frontend framework with the tagline <code class="highlighter-rouge">Cybernetically enhanced web apps</code>.</p>

<p>I wanted to check it out and see what all the fuss is about. I decided to blog about the experience in a live fashion and I will be writing this as I go.</p>

<p><em>Will I find it amazing? or will I hate it?, Will I even get time to try it out properly and actually complete this journal?, letâ€™s find out!</em></p>

<h2 id="hour-0---i-dont-know-svelte-at-all">Hour 0 - I donâ€™t know Svelte at all.</h2>

<p>I opened https://svelte.dev, And the main selling points were</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Write less code - <em>Boilerplate-free components.</em> Ah, like most other framework promises, but fails to deliver? letâ€™s seeâ€¦</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No virtual DOM - <em>Svelte compiles to vanilla JavaScript.</em> Wait, that is actually quite interesting. I definitely wanna see it in action.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Truly reactive - <em>No complex state management libraries, reactivity within JavaScript.</em> Nice. I have always been a fan of less dependencies.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Enough talk, letâ€™s dive into some Hello World!.</p>

<p>Starting with an empty Svelte project was way easier than I imagined. I started with the sveltejs/template and used <a href="https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit">degit</a> for project scaffolding as recommended.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>npx degit sveltejs/template project-name
<span class="nb">cd </span>project-name
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And then install and run using</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>npm <span class="nb">install
</span>npm run dev
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Phew, that just went good!</p>

<p>I like it when things just work without having to go on <em>stackoverflow treasure hunt</em> to fix things.</p>

<p>Time to learn something solid: https://svelte.dev/tutorial/basics</p>

<ul>
  <li>An application is composed of one or more <strong>Components</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Components</strong> are reusable block of code which contains HTML, CSS and JS that belong together in a .svelte file. -&gt; <em>thatâ€™s pretty neat. I donâ€™t have to write 3 different files for every component!</em></li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;style&gt;</code> contains all CSS. <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;script&gt;</code> contains all JS and the rest is HTML</li>
  <li>Variable names in JS can just be used directly with <code class="highlighter-rouge">{varName}</code>, when the value changes, the value in the page changes as well. -&gt; <em>This means no more this.refresh() or this.setValue() calls. I already like this a lot.</em></li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;img {src} alt="A man dances."&gt;</code> Just works when src is an image reference. I donâ€™t even have to provide <code class="highlighter-rouge">src={src}</code>. -&gt; <em>Ok, maybe thatâ€™s a bit too much for shorthanding? do I hate it? No.</em></li>
  <li>Whatever CSS that I add is scoped only to the component! It wonâ€™t affect rest of the component. -&gt; <em>I can safely mess with CSS and expect the whole page to not break now</em></li>
  <li>Use <code class="highlighter-rouge">import Nested from './Nested.svelte';</code> to import other components and use them.</li>
  <li>Use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">$: name = firstName + lastName;</code> syntax to make sure name is reactive and gets updated whenever firstName/lastName changes! <code class="highlighter-rouge">$</code> here is a JavaScript label which says execute this statement whenever any of the values are updated which is pretty neat. (another usecase will be to log a value whenever it changes!)</li>
</ul>

<p>I learned a bit more, but writing it all out here will be boring for me and anyone who is reading this. So I recommend you to try it out yourself.</p>
