# An Average LinkedIn Feed

I don't open LinkedIn every other day, as in it's not a social media I would spend more than 10 minutes on (well, to be fair, I don't spend more than 10 minutes on any social media these days, maybe Reddit?, but that's not a social media I guess).

Still, I do take LinkedIn to accept pending connections and see what's going on around in the professional side of things and here is my question

**Is it just me or does everyone get a LinkedIn feed like**



Some Guy: "I just got another certification from Coursera on Graphic Designing #coursera #certificates"


That wannabe hacker: "Coding is better when you have two monitors and three keyboards #HackerLife #DarkWeb"


Random Girl: "I was rejected in my interview despite having all the qualifications. This means X and I learned that {insert life lesson here} and {insert generic advice}. Don't ever give up #motivation #failureIsSuccess "

That cool developer guy: "JavaScript tips #4591: If you want to evaluate an expression in JavaScript, you can use eval(); #learning #javascript #follow4more #hourlytips"

Guy 3: "Thank you all. I just got certified in pointless bragging by coursera. Thanks everyone who supported me, it was really a great experience and I learned a lot. #udemy"


The same girl again: "When I was 2 years old, I asked my brother what Google is, he replied it's somewhere you go for all answers. but today I'm going for an interview at Google. Thank you all for the support #wishmeLuck"


Another story guy: "when my mother asked me what I do at work, I told her all about programming, blockchain, microtransactions and pain of existence, she didn't understand anything and then she said: "acchcha.... I have made dinner, come and eat when you're done", so this simply means that it doesn't matter what you do. at the end of the day, it should bring food to the table. #Hacker #4Monitors #LifeLesson"



Okay, okay, I hear youu. I did exaggerate a bit too much, but this isn't very far from the reality, also don't get me started on some other cliche posts like {Just got my offer letter, Incoming KHL at XYZ Inc, My salary used to be 5 digits but it is 6 digits now, I NEED HELP, SOMEBODY FIND ME A NEW JOB}


I can grep my LinkedIn homepage and get atleast 7 results with "coursera"
