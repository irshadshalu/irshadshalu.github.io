What better alternative to name your first post ever with "Hello, World!", than anything else?

To be honest, I don't think the first program I've ever written was a "Hello World!". I don't even remember what I wrote, but I do remember getting excited about printing text in different colours in BASIC. Ah, the good old `10 CLS` times.
