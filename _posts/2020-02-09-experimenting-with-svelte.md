# Experimenting with Svelte - A Journal 

It's a good bright sunday, I had a nice lunch, took a short nap and now back infront of the laptop - bored and thinking of doing something productive. 

That's when I remembered [**Svelte**](http://svelte.dev/); the super awesome brand new web frontend framework with the tagline `Cybernetically enhanced web apps`. 

I wanted to check it out and see what all the fuss is about. I decided to blog about the experience in a live fashion and I will be writing this as I go. 


## Hour 0 - I don't know Svelte at all.
