It's a good bright sunday, I had a nice lunch, took a short nap and now back infront of the laptop - bored and thinking of doing something productive. 

That's when I remembered [**Svelte**](https://svelte.dev/); the super awesome brand new web frontend framework with the tagline `Cybernetically enhanced web apps`. 



I wanted to check it out and see what all the fuss is about. I decided to blog about the experience in a live fashion and I will be writing this as I go. 


_Will I find it amazing? or will I hate it?, Will I even get time to try it out properly and actually complete this journal?, let's find out!_


## Hour 0 - I don't know Svelte at all. 


I opened [https://svelte.dev](https://svelte.dev), And the main selling points were


* Write less code - _Boilerplate-free components._ Ah, like most other framework promises, but fails to deliver? let's see...

* No virtual DOM - _Svelte compiles to vanilla JavaScript._ Wait, that is actually quite interesting. I definitely wanna see it in action. 

* Truly reactive - _No complex state management libraries, reactivity within JavaScript._ Nice. I have always been a fan of less dependencies. 


Enough talk, let's dive into some Hello World!.
